There was, there wasn't . .  In a land far away - a great and mighty Kurdish tribe
called the Babanis. The Babani men were known throughout the land for their patriotic 
sentiments, their fierce fighting habits and their sexual prowess.  
In contrast, the women were said to be kind, forgiving, hardworking and excellent cooks. 
In this respect the men and women were well suited for one another. 
And so as one may imagine the tribe flourished spreading children throughtout Kurdistan. 
In more recent years, the great leaders of this mighty empire could not contain the curiosity of 
young men whose desires to explore the treasures of exotic lands were insatiable. In keeping with 
their Babani male tradition, this especially applied to the wonders of women. 
So many as we say here in Minnesota, "took to the trials". 
One exceptionally brave and handsome young man;<br><br>
Jamal, son of Abdul Karim, Mohammed, Qadir, Gafur Fuad' was the first to leave his tribe. 
He made his way to the Americas where one day he heard some interesting news on the radio. 
The reporter was saying, "In Minnesota the women are strong, blond and beautiful . . . their children
are far above average." He needed no more cajoling (for he felt the news was directed at him) 
before he found himself among this mysteriously mild yet unsparing culture. 
And as he had hoped he soon met Gail, a most beautiful young blond maiden. 
Much to his delight he realized that she had many of the qualities of the women of his 
great Babani tribe. Still, he was unsuccessful in convincing his parents of this face. 
And Gail's parents, Barb and Ed, were unimpressed by Jamal's tribal ancestry. 
In spite of the many protests Gail and Jamal were soon to marry . . . 
And this is how the first Kurdish restaurant came to be in Minnesota . . . The End
